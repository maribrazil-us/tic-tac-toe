# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game React App**

### Description

Play the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. This project created a game board for two players with React. This exercise focuses on managing state across parent and child components i.e. the board keeps track of each square in the game and each square keeps track of whose turn it is ('X' or '0').

### How to run 

You will need to initiate a local server to launch the application. Once in the application, you can start playing. To start a new game, refresh the page.

### Roadmap

Future interesting improvements for users would be to have a reset/start new game button. Once we have that, we can a score board to keep track of winnings from each player, since we won't have to refresh the whole page. It would also be interesting to add a message of draw if that's the case at the end of the game. The roadmap is TBD.
